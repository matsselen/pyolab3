"""
Files starting with the name "user", like this one, are provided 
so that users can create their own analysis jobs.

These user methods are a handy way to try and isolate the user code from the 
library code.  

In this particular example the user code print out any accelerometer data that 
is received from the remote, and at the end of the job it prints a summary of
the records and data that were received from the system.
